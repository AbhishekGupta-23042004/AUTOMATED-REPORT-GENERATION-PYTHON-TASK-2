In this task, we created a Python project that reads data from a file, performs basic analysis, and generates a clean and formatted PDF report. The main aim of this task is to understand how we can automate the process of reading and analyzing data, and then converting that analysis into a professional report. We used a sample CSV file named sample_data.csv that contains information about students such as their names, ages, departments, marks, and attendance percentages. First, we loaded this CSV file into our Python program using the pandas library, which is widely used for data analysis and data manipulation. After reading the file, we focused on the numeric columns like Age, Marks, and Attendance. We used the describe() function in pandas to calculate important statistical values such as the count, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and quartiles for each numeric column. This helped us understand the overall performance and trends in the dataset. Once we had the analysis results, we used the fpdf library to generate a formatted PDF report. In the PDF, we included a title, total number of students, list of departments, and summary statistics for each numeric column. Each section of the report was clearly labeled and properly spaced to make the report easy to read and understand. To make the report more informative and visually appealing, we also created a bar graph showing the average marks of students in each department. We used the matplotlib library to create the graph, saved it as an image, and then inserted the image into the PDF report using fpdf. This allowed us to combine both numerical summaries and visual information in one single document. We also added a section in the PDF that lists how many students belong to each department, giving us a department-wise breakdown of the data. All these details made the report more complete and useful for teachers, management, or anyone who needs to review the student data. By completing this task, we learned how to automate repetitive tasks like data analysis and reporting using Python. We understood how to read structured data from files, process the data using pandas, create graphs using matplotlib, and export everything neatly into a PDF using fpdf. This task shows how automation can save time and improve accuracy when generating reports, especially when working with large datasets. It also gave us hands-on experience with popular Python libraries that are used in data science and analytics fields. Automating reports is very useful in real life for schools, colleges, businesses, and government organizations where regular reports need to be generated from changing data. Instead of doing everything manually in Excel or Word, Python can handle the job faster and more efficiently. Overall, this task was a great way to combine file handling, data processing, data visualization, and report creation all in one project. It helped improve our Python skills, and also taught us how to present data in a meaningful and professional format that is ready to be shared or printed
